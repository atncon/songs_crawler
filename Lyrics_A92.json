the whole clip empty\nThem boy ain't nothing but pagions\nI can see why them boy love envy\nI want LV, Prada or Gucci\nI might just offend my opps in Fendi\nAnd when juice get spilled like soda\nNo I won't say no words like Kenny\n\n[Verse 2: Dbo]\nMy hand ting coming like Corona\nIf it coughs twice then it's turning you pack\nThey say that we come like athletes\nCircle your block and we do them laps\nAll out attack tryna get this pagion\nAll out attack in the fields, don't lack\nHe thought he was big lik\u0435 mac\n'Till I pulled out this stick tryna swing for backs\n[Verse 3: Trapboy BT]\nIn the bando, no Kay\nBut I still make K\u2019s from this Lyca sim\nTh\u0435 jake boys irritate my skin\nCan't put me in the bin, no comment, can't sing\nDont sing like 6, dont snitch like 9\nStill circle the nine 2 times\nWith a machine no gym\nTryna put him in the sky\nMake an opp boy fly\nGet whacked by mine\n\n[Verse 4: Offica]\nWhere them at, where them be, where the paigons get?\nMake the boy's eyes look like an asian\nMan we get round there on any occasion\nIt ain't a ride out, it's an invasion\nAnd if you fuck with them, it's a simple equation\nYou're an opp boy, your a paigon\nA ti lo a ti d\u00e9, more time when we slide round there its a quick ting, no calculation\n\n[Verse 5: Ksav]\nBy God\u2019s grace I dont end up a lifer\nBut I still slide, see me and we\u2019ll ride out\nI ying yang like China, rip 2 g\u2019s\nMake them drip like designer\nOn the block dressed in black like China\nFresh air ones, see me in my sliders\nHopefully I ain't got to remind yous\nUp the A and fuck the Niners\nI can't stand them boy from the Nine\nAll they know is tell lies, tell lies\nBut there main boy got splashed, baptised\nAnd another Nine boy got hospitalised\nAny talk on the A get bun\nDrills get done by me and the guys\nDbo tryna swing for backs\nHe can't swing for backs, so they stay inside\n[Verse 6: Dbo]\nScar man\u2019s face like Al Pacino\nBuck into A and you can hold 2 on the pain, no free throw\nBow, bun, and the gun need reload\nStuck in the trap with one eye open\nHoping the cats don't drop that kilo\nDbo, fundz you can\u2019t miss me on road\nFundz, 'cause man's got green like Cee-Lo\nBro bro went and bust that gun\nI dont think that he\u2019ll bust that case\nThey say we dont slide to the B\nBut Foomey\u2019s gaff got smashed, no trace\nThey left Rexy fighting for his life\nOn a hospital bed, got chinged broad day\nA1 give her dick in her belly, which side is she on?\nAsk your pagion bae\n\n[Verse 7: Trapboy BT]\nAbout slide to the B, we slide to the B\nHow many man got chased by we?\nAnd lil' man Rose got got times 3\nAll the Niners, watched them flee\nWas me and MZ tryna catch them three\nTryna switch it like OT Chi\nBut I'm in OT tryna make this cheese\nI lurked down the B Town strip\nI was pissed that he didn't get hit\nTell bro rise that mash and spit\nAim for his top or aim for his wig\nI seen bro grab that stick\nBally on his face, he's taking that risk\nLet sticks beat like drum kit\nPull up on them and pump it\nTryna let it blow like trumpets\nAt them muppets\n[Verse 8: Offica]\nBro said to hold this stick\nMan you need them muscles\nHe let it spray like Mr Muscles\nChocolate ting from Belgium, Brussels\nShe wanna go low\nMan bring them bottles\nWait, she wanna jiggle and wiggle\nThis bad b one split in the middle\nLeng, bunda come fat, not little\nAll my girls them sweet like Skittles\nYo, baby, how you move like that?\nThis gyally wanna arch her back\nGo low, limbo, limbo, touch your toe\nNo Elvis, baby, when I rock and roll\nMe and my guys, we flow like the river\nChat loos, get one in your liver\nOr maybe your intestine\nI got love for my gang, don't test man\n\n[Verse 9: Ksav]\nI got washed up opps, it's peak\n'Cause you man move gay, that's suttin' like Marvin\nOut in the town tryna dish these foods\nEnds are hot, but these cats be starving\nWe score them goals like Fifa\nBut we don't commentate like Marvin\nNo Taylor when we got down Swift\n2 more down, that's no more targets\n\n[Verse 10: Dbo]\nI do them in my Nike tracksuit and sliders\nI do that there in my LV kicks\nMust be the one who's spreading this virus\n'Cause everyone knows that my flows too sick\nOT flying, we riding\nOut on the field tryna catch me a prick\nBando days, we spin 'round driving\nWave this wand in my hand, no wiz\n\n[Verse 11: Trapboy BT]\nAy, I've been in the T with profit\nBruck down buds tryna make that profit\nThey chat on the net and gossip\nA92, we the hottest topic\nShout SS for the pocket rocket\nDBO got the plug like socket\nI been 'round there on a madness\nWatch them dash\nWhat happened to the badness?\n\n[Verse 12: Offica]\nIn the block like awon da oya b\u2019ota\nHow many points have we scored in the last few weeks?\nMeji, merin, mefa\nOn the ball, 22 on my back like Kaka\nBro scores like Laca\nShoot and they scatter\nWatch them man japa\nBoppity bop, boppity bop\nGbe soke ju sile omo dancer"
